  "description": "This DAG template represents a typical remote sensing workflow for Defense & Security intelligence analysis. It starts with satellite imagery acquisition and a sequential pre-processing chain (geometric/atmospheric correction, cloud removal, resolution enhancement) to create Analysis-Ready Data (ARD). From the ARD, it fans out to parallel feature extraction tasks like object detection (vehicles, ships, buildings) and land cover classification. These initial findings are then 'fanned-in' to higher-level thematic assessments (e.g., force deployment, infrastructure analysis). Finally, all intelligence products are synthesized to analyze threat patterns and generate a conclusive report, mirroring a standard GEOINT cycle."
